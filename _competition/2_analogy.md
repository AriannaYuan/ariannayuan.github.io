title: Domain-General Learning of Neural Network Models for Analogical Reasoning
image: /images/competitions/analogy.png
description: We built domain-general neural network models that learn to solve analogy tasks in different modalities (texts and images) using word representations and image representations learned from large-scale naturalistic corpus. The model reproduces key findings in the analogical reasoning literature, including relational shift and familiarity effect.
