title: Generating Random Sequences For You -- Modeling Subjective Randomness in Competitive Games
image: /images/competitions/sub_random.png
description: We built two probabilistic models of Theory of Mind reasoning about subjective randomness and implemented them in WebPPL. Our work suggests that the calibrated subjective randomness in competitive games can be explained by the online evaluation of sequence randomness with Theory of Mind reasoning.
