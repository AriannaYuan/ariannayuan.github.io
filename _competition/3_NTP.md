title: Neural Theorem Prover
image: /images/competitions/NTP.jpg
description: We built a neural network model to prove theorems in logical forms. Particularly, the model receives a set of axioms (premises) and a theorem to prove (goal). The model needs to select multiple axioms from the axiom list that could prove the goal theorem. We reframe it as a sequence to sequence learning problem, and use double recurrent neural networks to encode the theorem and output a sequence of axioms.
