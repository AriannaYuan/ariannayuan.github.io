title: Generating Texts for Natural Language Inference
image: /images/competitions/NNL_gen.png
description: We trained Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural networks to generate sentences that were either entailed or contradicted by given sentences. Specifically, we built a multi-tasking LSTM RNN that performed the Entailment task and the Contradiction task simultaneously and visualized these recurrent neural networks to investigate how they made logical inference in natural language.
