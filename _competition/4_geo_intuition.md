title: Emergence of Euclidean Geometrical Intuitions in Hierarchical Generative Models

description: We built a deep autoencoder to reconstruct geometric figures and analyzed the representations of deep-belief networks by visualizing the response profiles of hidden units. We found that some units demonstrate numerosity-sensitivity as the parietal neurons in the primate brain do.
