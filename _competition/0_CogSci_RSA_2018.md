title: Understanding the Rational Speech Act Model (CogSci2018)

description: The Rational Speech Act (RSA) model proposes that probabilistic speakers and listeners recursively reason about each otherâ€™s mental states to communicate. It has been quite successful in explaining many pragmatic reasoning phenomena. In this paper, we systematically analyzed the RSA model and found that in Monte Carlo simulations pragmatic listeners and speakers always outperform their literal counterparts and the expected accuracy increases as the number of recursions increases. Furthermore, limiting the computation resources of the speaker and listener so they sample only the top k most likely options leads to higher expected accuracy. We verified these results on a previously collected natural language dataset in color reference games.
