title: Bias and Generalization in Deep Generative Models -- An Empirical Study (2018)
image: /images/competitions/concept_illustration.png
description: In high dimensional settings, density estimation algorithms rely crucially on their inductive bias. Despite recent empirical success, the inductive bias of deep gen- erative models is not well understood. In this project we propose a framework to systematically investigate bias and generalization in deep generative models of images by probing the learning algorithm with carefully designed training datasets. We exactly characterize the learned distribution to study if/how the model generates novel features and novel combinations of existing features. We identify similarities to human psychology and verify that these patterns are consistent across datasets, common models and architectures.
